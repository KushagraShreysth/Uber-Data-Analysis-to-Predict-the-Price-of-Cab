## About Project 

This project is based on machine learning and its algorithms which predicts trip prices based on various factors , like , Temperature, Location, Clouds, Pressure, Distance, etc.. I have taken data of Uber and Lyft. They are greatly affected by the demand and supply of rides at a given time. 

I got to understand what drives the demand of the rides and how the prices vary with time and weather conditions. 

My objective was to understand the factors that influence the price of a cab and to predict trip prices based on these factors and finally created a model for it and it was working nicely.
